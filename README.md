This project was Created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a React Application to fetch the data from the API and display the results in a tabular view.
The Application is Built using REACTJS.

Features of this Project is 

1. Make an HTTP request to fetch the data from the URL.

2. Create a table that displays the fetched data. The table should include at least 5 
columns and at least 10 rows. The table should also have a row of headers that each display a label for the corresponding column of data. When a header is clicked, the table rows should be sorted according to that header. 

3. Create a filter for the table that will allow users to display only the table rows to which the 
filter applies. For example, if I filter by an ID, I should only see the one row of data which has that ID. Give thought to what type of input should be used for each filter input (e.g. “Should I use a text input, a select, or something else?”). Users should be able to filter by these properties: a. Name b. Name Type c. ID d. Year e. Recclass 

4. When a row in the table is clicked, a card should display a more detailed view of the data 
for that item.
